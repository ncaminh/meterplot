# watts

This little script takes a number of energy measurements (e.g., from your
electricity meter or old power bills) and displays the wattage over time.

For example, with the data file
```
- date: 2016-01-01 00:00
  value: 1000
- date: 2016-02-01 00:00
  value: 1200
- date: 2016-04-01 00:00
  value: 2000
- date: 2016-07-01 00:00
  value: 3500
- date: 2016-10-01 00:00
  value: 4000
```
you'll get
```
./show_data test.yml
```
